# Uxperiment

Simple experiments with webgl and interaction with 3d objects, just for fun, released under the MIT license.

Currently includes a depth-peeling renderer that supports transparent objects in a way that makes physical sense,
with some quick and dirty SSAO and FXAA to give a bit more original look than the over-shiny specularities.
