# Uxperiment

Simple experiments in 3d object interaction in webgl, just for fun really.

You can find this running at [anyrhine.com](http://anyrhine.com/demo.html) if you want to take a look.

Currently includes a depth-peeling renderer that supports transparent objects in a way that makes physical sense,
with some quick and dirty SSAO and FXAA to give a bit more original look.
